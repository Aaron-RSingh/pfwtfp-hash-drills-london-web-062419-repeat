# Hash Drills

## Learning Goals

1. Perform operations on hashes guided by tests

## Introduction

We've discussed a few different ways that hashes can be created and
how useful they are in storing and retrieving associated data with ease.
In this lessons we're going to do exercises that will help us practice
working with hashes.


### Perform Operations on Hashes Guided by Tests

* Analyze a hash and identify existing keys and their values
* Build out new hashes by harvesting multiple nested keys
* Modify an existing hash

We're going to host a dinner party! We have a shopping list of nutritious ingredients, but we are going to prepare separate dishes for guests with dietary restrictions: Vegetarian, Ketogenic, and Mediterranean.

#### Building New Hashes

Since these recipes will require some attention to detail, we're going to build 3 hashes to represent 3 separate shopping lists for guests with dietary restrictions.

* For the vegetarian dishes, the ingredients will contain: Sweets, Eggs, Nuts, Vegetables, Fruits, and Grains

* For the ketogenic dishes, the ingredients will contain: Eggs, Nuts, Vegetables, Dairy, and Meat

* For the mediterranean dishes, the ingredients will contain: Nuts, Vegetables, Yogurt & Cheese, and White Meat (Chicken & Fish), Fruits, and Grains

#### Modifying Existing Hashes

Now that we've sorted out mostly universal ingredients between our shopping lists, to be sure to accommodate all guests, we're going to modify our vegetarian list and our mediterranean lists.

* Remove dairy and eggs from our vegetarian hash to create a 4th list for vegan.
* Add wine to our mediterranean hash--those guests love wine!

## Conclusion

You should now have a total of 4 hashes with a combination of the original list of ingredients, plus added wine. Your guests will be elated. Bon appetit!
